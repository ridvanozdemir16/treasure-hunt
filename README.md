The aim of the project is to develop a two-player, two-level strategy game in which rewards and penalties determine the way of players to the treasure. The first player who reaches the treasure wins the game.
   
Initially, each player waits in the starting lounge of the game board. Player (P) plays the game first. Players throw the dice in each turn to move on the board. According to the number on the dice, players take step. After both players play, round number is updated. The first player who reaches the treasure wins the game. The game includes 2 boards: 1 dimensional board and 2 dimensional board. User can select the board type from the menu at the beginning of the game. Boards consist of squares. 1D board has 1 x 25 squares, and 2D board has 12 x 12 squares.
